#  E-Commerce Web Based Application

## About This Project

This is a personal project developed as part of my learning. Some features are simplified or intentionally skipped for demonstration purposes: 

- **Admin CRUD are skipped.**
- **Product images are skipped.**
- **Admin routes can be accessed by customers for demo purposes.**

**Role-based access can be verified via the /auth/me endpoint (role === `admin`), which returns the authenticated user object. **

This project consists of:

- **Client** (React)
- **Spring Boot Backend Server**
- **Redis**
- **MySQL**
---

## ‚ú® Features
- **User Authentication** (Sign in/up and log out)
- **View Available products**
